# Information-Retrieval
Implemetation of a basic IR system using Python + NLTK

- **MiniProject 1**: Develop an Information Retrieval (IR) system that supports both standard Boolean queries and proximity queries.
  
- **MiniProject 2**: Enhance a basic Information Retrieval (IR) system by handling Spelling Correction and Wildcard Queries
  
- **MiniProject 3**: Construct an Information Retrieval (IR) system using the Block-Sorted Based Indexing (BSBI) algorithm (+ Gamma Coding)
  
- **MiniProject 4**: Augment a basic Information Retrieval (IR) system by incorporating different Document Ranking strategies (Space Vector Model, Probabilistic Model, Language Model)

- **MiniProject 5**: Implement a Naive Bayes classifier, integrate word embeddings with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and apply SVM
